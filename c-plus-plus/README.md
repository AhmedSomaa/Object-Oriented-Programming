> 🖮  All the projects are developed using the standard version of C++ which is (C++17).

> ⚠️ All projects are developed by separating the class into two files:
>
> - __Header File - classname.h__
>   - Contains the declaration of all the class members.
>   - Only attributes declaration and methods prototypes.
>
> - __Implementation File - classname.cpp__
>   - Contains the implementation of the class methods.
>
> - __Driver (Client) Code - main.cpp__
>   - is the one that includes the main code that tests our classes.
